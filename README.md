**Project 4: NLP: Transformer for English to Hindi Conversion** <br />
Transformer models are a powerful architecture for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as language translation. They can be effectively trained for English to Hindi conversion using parallel corpora of English and Hindi sentences. A transformer-based model for English to Hindi conversion can be trained by pre-processing the parallel corpora, creating a dataset, and fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model on this dataset. <br />
